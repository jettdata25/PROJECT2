So I did a linear regression, LASSO, and Ridge regression on red wine quality based on its numerically valued features which may or may not affect its quality. I gathered a file on Kaggle as can be seen in this project, and it did not work.
But then I tried doing non-linear regression models which may have worked more than the linear ones. Maybe the correlation is not linear after all.
